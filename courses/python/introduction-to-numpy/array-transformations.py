""" Loading .npy files
The exercises for this chapter will use a NumPy array holding an image in RGB format. Which image? You'll have to load the array from the mystery_image.npy file to find out!

numpy is loaded as np, and mystery_image.npy is available.

Instructions
Load the mystery_image.npy file using the alias f, saving the contents as an array called rgb_array.

""" Getting help
You'll need to use the .astype() array method we covered in the first chapter of this course for the next exercise. If you forget exactly how .astype() works, you could check out the course slides or NumPy's documentation on numpy.org. There is, however, an even faster way to jog your memoryâ€¦

Instructions
Return NumPy's documentation text for .astype().

""" Update and save
Perhaps you are training a machine learning model to recognize ocean scenes. You'd like the model to understand that oceans are not only associated with bright, summery colors, so you're careful to include images of oceans in bad weather or evening light as well. You may have to manually transform some images in order to balance the data, so your task is to darken the Monet ocean scene rgb_array.

Recall from the video that white is associated with the maximum RGB value of 255, while darker colors are associated with lower values. numpy is loaded as np, and the 3D Monet rgb_array that you loaded in the last exercise is available.

Instructions 1/3
Reduce every value in rgb_array by 50 percent, saving the resulting array as darker_rgb_array.
Instructions 2/3
Since RGB values must be integers, convert darker_rgb_array into an array of integers called darker_rgb_int_array so that it can be plotted.
Instructions 3/3
Save darker_rgb_int_array as an .npy file called darker_monet.npy using the alias f.

""" Augmenting Monet
Perhaps you're still working on that machine learning model that identifies ocean scenes in paintings. You'd like to generate a few extra images to augment your existing data. After all, a human can tell that a painting is of an ocean even if the painting is upside-down: why shouldn't your machine learning model?

numpy is loaded as np, and the 3D Monet rgb_array is available.

Instructions 1/2
Flip rgb_array so that it is the mirror image of the original, with the ocean on the right and grassy knoll on the left.
Instructions 2/2
Flip rgb_array so that it is upside down but otherwise remains the same.

""" Transposing your masterpiece
You've learned that transposing an array reverses the order of the array's axes. To transpose the axes in a different order, you can pass the desired axes order as arguments. You'll practice with the 3D Monet rgb_array, loaded for you. numpy has been imported as np.

Instructions
Transpose the 3-D rgb_array so that the image appears rotated 90 degrees left and as a mirror image of itself.

""" 2D split and stack
Splitting and stacking skills aren't just useful with 3D RGB arrays: they are excellent for subsetting and organizing data of any type and dimension!

You'll now take a quick trip down memory lane to reorganize the monthly_sales array as a 3D array. Recall that the first dimension of monthly_sales is rows of a single month's sales across three industries, and the second dimension is columns of monthly sales data for a single industry.

Your task is to split this data into quarterly sales data and stack the quarterly sales data so that the new third dimension represents the four 2D arrays of quarterly sales.numpy is loaded as np, and the monthly_sales array is available.

Instructions 1/2
Split monthly_sales into four arrays representing quarterly data across industries; print q1_sales.
Instructions 2/2
Stack the four quarterly sales arrays to create a 3D array, quarterly_sales, made up of the four quarterly 2D arrays in order from the first to last quarter.

Perhaps you'd like to better understand Monet's use of the color blue.
