"""Creating features
In this chapter, you will work with a dataset called sales_df, which contains information on advertising campaign expenditure across different media types, and the number of dollars generated in sales for the respective campaign. The dataset has been preloaded for you. Here are the first two rows:

     tv        radio      social_media    sales
1    13000.0   9237.76    2409.57         46677.90
2    41000.0   15886.45   2913.41         150177.83
You will use the advertising expenditure as features to predict sales values, initially working with the "radio" column. However, before you make any predictions you will need to create the feature and target arrays, reshaping them to the correct format for scikit-learn.

Instructions
Create X, an array of the values from the sales_df DataFrame's "radio" column.
Create y, an array of the values from the sales_df DataFrame's "sales" column.
Reshape X into a two-dimensional NumPy array.
Print the shape of X and y.

X = X.reshape(-1, 1)

# Check the shape of the features and targets
print(X.shape, y.shape)


""" Building a linear regression model
Now you have created your feature and target arrays, you will train a linear regression model on all feature and target values.

As the goal is to assess the relationship between the feature and target values there is no need to split the data into training and test sets.

X and y have been preloaded for you as follows:

y = sales_df["sales"].values
X = sales_df["radio"].values.reshape(-1, 1)

Instructions
Import LinearRegression.
Instantiate a linear regression model.
Predict sales values using X, storing as predictions.

""" Visualizing a linear regression model
Now you have built your linear regression model and trained it using all available observations, you can visualize how well the model fits the data. This allows you to interpret the relationship between radio advertising expenditure and sales values.

The variables X, an array of radio values, y, an array of sales values, and predictions, an array of the model's predicted values for y given X, have all been preloaded for you from the previous exercise.

Instructions
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Create a scatter plot visualizing y against X, with observations in blue.
Draw a red line plot displaying the predictions against X.

""" Fit and predict for regression
Now you have seen how linear regression works, your task is to create a multiple linear regression model using all of the features in the sales_df dataset, which has been preloaded for you. As a reminder, here are the first two rows:

2    41000.0   15886.45   2913.41         150177.83
You will then use this model to predict sales based on the values of the test features.

LinearRegression and train_test_split have been preloaded for you from their respective modules.

Instructions
Create X, an array containing values of all features in sales_df, and y, containing all values from the "sales" column.

""" Regression performance
Now you have fit a model, reg, using all features from sales_df, and made predictions of sales values, you can evaluate performance using some common regression metrics.

The variables X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, and y_pred, along with the fitted model, reg, all from the last exercise, have been preloaded for you.

Your task is to find out how well the features can explain the variance in the target values, along with assessing the model's ability to make predictions on unseen data.

""" Cross-validation for R-squared
Cross-validation is a vital approach to evaluating a model. It maximizes the amount of data that is available to the model, as the model is not only trained but also tested on all of the available data.

In this exercise, you will build a linear regression model, then use 6-fold cross-validation to assess its accuracy for predicting sales using social media advertising expenditure. You will display the individual score for each of the six-folds.

The sales_df dataset has been split into y for the target variable, and X for the features, and preloaded for you. LinearRegression has been imported from sklearn.linear_model.
