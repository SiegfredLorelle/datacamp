/* Numbering rows
The simplest application for window functions is numbering rows. Numbering rows allows you to easily fetch the nth row. For example, it would be very difficult to get the 35th row in any given table if you didn't have a column with each row's number.

Instructions
Number each row in the dataset.

The Summer Olympics dataset contains the results of the games between 1896 and 2012. The first Summer Olympics were held in 1896, the second in 1900, and so on.

Instructions
Assign a number to each year in which Summer Olympic games were held.

Row numbering can also be used for ranking. For example, numbering rows and ordering by the count of medals each athlete earned in the OVER clause will assign 1 to the highest-earning medalist, 2 to the second highest-earning medalist, and so on.

Instructions 1/2
For each athlete, count the number of medals he or she has earned.
Instructions 2/2
Having wrapped the previous query in the Athlete_Medals CTE, rank each athlete by the number of medals they've earned.

A reigning champion is a champion who's won both the previous and current years' competitions. To determine if a champion is reigning, the previous and current years' results need to be in the same row, in two different columns.
